# Hey_Day_script
This is a simple script that celebrates Auburn's Annual "Hey Day".

# How it works
When I run the script, it asks for my name and then greets me with a personalized message for the event.

# What is a Hey Day?

Link: http://sga.auburn.edu/hey-day/, Hey Day is a cherished Auburn tradition that unites students, faculty, 
and alums in a lively celebration of school spirit. Every year, the campus hosts a range of activities, including 
games, music, and delicious food, fostering a joyful atmosphere that embodies the spirit of community. This event 
strengthens bonds within the Auburn family and serves as a reminder of the university's rich history and pride. 
Whether you're a current student or an alum, Hey Day is a special occasion that evokes nostalgia and creates enduring
memories. The theme for the 2024 Hey Day shirts at Auburn University is to celebrate the history of the Auburn family.
